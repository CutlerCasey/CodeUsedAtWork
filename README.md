# Code Used At Work
Scripts I have used to automae some work related tasks
- AS400 Macros
  - VBA type script
  - Used as a Driver Manager for a Transportation company
  - Unless you work at the company I did, it would be hard to use these Macros out of the box
    - But they might give you ideas if you are using an AS400 system
- Excel Macros
  - KeepAlive
    - Excel Macros
    - Randomly makes the mouse move and clicks where it moved to
      - Does not move far, just far enough for you to stay logged in while thinking about your next objective
    - Might have to adjust the Script a bit to make it work in your system
